what's going on guys today is another fun training because we're diving even deeper into the level of sophistication that you can carry as an Advertiser see it's one thing to see a headline see a hook see value prompts that doesn't make you a sophisticated Advertiser it could make you a marketer but what I want to talk about today is when you can see through the Matrix right when you can see the components that make up a headline or make up a lead or make up a value prompt and you can distill them
00:46
down into core marketing principles such as what we're talking about today which is proof I don't just want to show you what proof is but I just want to show you the different components of proof different types of proof and even how to use them inside of your advertising today is going to be a fun one because we really get to nerd out on what very few people actually talk about and that is all about proof so without further Ado let's go ahead and dive in starting off with a quote the head certainly can't go along
01:14
and concur with the heart without some reasons now all this process is one of rationalization to rationalize is to bring props of reason to support decisions arrived at emotionally the skilled copywriter attempts to provide the reader of advertising with a basis for rationalization in short the real advertising writer who is after results makes the reader want something and then provides what the reader will consider a good excuse for buying it this is from the great and legendary Victor Schwab now a couple things I want to pull out
01:47
of this quote here one is the idea that at the very end right it provides what the reader will consider a good excuse for buying it here's what I want you to understand people love to be sold to people love to buy things consume things right that is the whole basis of consumerism right whether you believe it's a good thing or a negative thing the fact of the matter is is it exists and many people are looking for the excuse to buy it so you as an Advertiser as a copywriter as an ad man right a mad man
02:16
what I want you to do is realize that your readers are looking for a reason to purchase it but pulling at their emotions alone is not enough you should you have to give them a reason something for their brain to give an Excel itself an excuse to follow along with the heart right but also at the same time we'll talk about this in a bit is that without emotion none of this matters anyway you can have all the proof in the world but if you don't know the right emotions to pull your proof isn't that solid so
02:43
let's carry on where are we going today proof what is it why is it important I also want to talk about the types of facts that you can use inside of proof and then the types of proof structures how to use the facts within your proof structures and then proof stacking ultimately how do you do proof stacking what does it look like and I want to give you an example so let's start off why use proof why use proof contrary uh to popular belief the reader wants to believe an ad but only if your emotional triggers are
03:14
effective right proof becomes the path for the reader to justify their desire and acknowledge they made it clear and wise decision your goal is to know the right emotional triggers to pull and then the proper proof to then insert into your advertising to give the reader an excuse to convert right there's different types of facts that you can use within proof first is construction evidence right construction evidence includes any facts about materials and manufacturer of the product specifications of the quality concerning
03:46
ingredients design its details workmanship right if you're thinking about uh you know one of our partners steel home decor right we're going to talk about it's 100 American-made steel we're going to talk about how it's powder coated right so it can go indoors and Outdoors we're gonna say a lifetime warranty we're basically building up the construction evidence that hey this is a good product right that's one type of fact the next type is performance evidence right this includes the
04:11
achievements of a product in actual use this also includes like the achievements of a person right if this person is an example of the product it's performance evidence right let's say for example if we're trying to sell the you know Tesla Roadster we might say it goes 0-60 in 1.9 seconds 1.
04:31
8 seconds something ridiculous right that's a performance evidence next one is testimony of others this is includes experts or Awards uh this is kind of like the here's what happened Award right one time this did this right uh it's powerful forms of proof especially when paired with authority figure or an influencer itself and then the last type of proof is test evidence this is a guarantee demonstrating the Brand's willingness to allow the quality of the product to speak for itself think free plus shipping risk free trials right you
05:01
think a purple mattress how they give you you know like 99 sleeps or something like that for before you know if you don't like it and it's 99 sleeps in you can return it for a full refund right these are test evidence to where it's a form of proof because you are taking the risk off the table right now types of proof structures how to use the facts that we've shown you right how to use these guys inside your advertising there's a couple ways to do it one use statements that also ring true for example everyone knows that 9
05:33
out of 10 businesses fail but dot dot dot right if I was going to continue it'd be like everyone knows that 9 out of 10 businesses fail but did you know that you know the ten percent that succeed all have one thing in common dot dot dot dot dot right and then I'm going to start selling my product or service right the idea here is that oftentimes whenever uh you give too good to be true stuff you need to get on a Level Playing Field essentially with the prospect to give them something else they also agree
06:03
with for example when I tell you 9 out of 10 businesses fail you probably know that that's a true statement so you're more likely to assume that the next statement I give you is also true that's just a subconscious understanding right because all of a sudden we're now in the same playing field we believe that we see eye to eye each other you've already agreed with me on something and now I built up a small sense of leadership and Authority inside of your mind and so the next statement I give is most likely to
06:30
be agreed upon by you or it's going to lock in your focus more so that when I deliver the next uh you know statistic or understanding you're going to be more in tune to under try to figure out whether that's true or not by reading further along why because you've already accepted one statement I've given you now your brain is wanting to accept the next statement but if it doesn't immediately it's going to have more of an incentive to try to figure out whether it's right or wrong all right
06:57
the next way people are associated with claims of perfection right this means specific facts are more convincing than perfect facts example 99.4 percent is more convincing than me saying a hundred percent 48 effective is more convincing than me saying 50 effective right in the same way it's also uh more expected when you kind of say you know uh you know let's say nine out of ten doctors agree that this product is amazing right it's more believable than saying 10 out of 10 doctors believe this product is amazing
07:35
right the next way is get more Y into it customers are adapting faster and faster to advertising hacks employees promotion sales claims and evidence with your product needs to have a why behind it essentially you can't just throw out a random promotion expect people to have Massive Action on it this is not saying that you they won't take action on it it's saying more likely you're going to have a more effective outcome if you give a reason why behind it example making room for a summer sale now get 50
08:06
off everything in stock versus 50 off sale for everything in stock the top headline most likely will win when using a proper split test why because consumers need a reason why it doesn't have to be an amazing reason why but having a reason why behind the actions that you as a brand or a company are doing gives more Credence to the consumer or the advertising reader when they're looking at it right subconsciously the objection in their head will come up well is it actually 50 off there's a lot more questions that
08:35
come up but when I tell you hey we're making room for sale or hey it's a liquidation sale you're gonna have a much more understanding view in your head that you're not going to have that too good to be true sale mindset when you're reading that headline right now types of proof all right that was you have here uh types of facts these are types of proof structures now this is specific types of proof and this is ultimately what we're going to be calling out whenever we're reviewing any
09:03
ads on a call uh we might ask you is hey what types of proof is this these are the ones you're going to really want to remember hint AKA it might be on the exam types of proof first specificity I'm going to try to say that specificity ah whatever you know what I'm trying to say being specific within your claim to a certain time or number right what this essentially means is uh for example 99.
09:35
4 is specific right I'm getting a specific number if I said you know 3586 people have downloaded this book and said boom I'm adding specifics to the claim that I'm making right that's what that is next one historical proof this means the language that implies tried and true mentality right referencing Pass events experiments empirical evidence studies Etc are trying and trying and tying them uh to the now or the future essentially what I'm saying is let's say for example there was actually I wonder if I'm going to go over here yep we'll go over that in a
10:11
second so essentially six thousand years old I'm going to show you that in a second an example of that expert proof connecting a claim or promises validity to a valid expert or influencer to back up or validate a claim essentially for example 9 out of 10 doctors believe blah blah blah right I'm at it in some kind of expertise to the headline or the lead or the copy whatever it is I'm adding some kind of authority figure or trusted figure into the copy in order for to tie my claim to the expert the next one is
10:42
mechanism validating a claim or promise to the use of a proprietary or exclusive process or a system that allows the claim to be made for example we talked about earlier where Tesla's new tablets battery allows for Teslas to be now more affordable than ever well what I'm doing is I'm basically adding in the mechanism to validate the reason why behind my I can actually make my claim right which actually kind of leads into the next one which is kind of a tie you can always stack these together which we're
11:11
actually talking about a second but the mechanism essentially in that case is the tablets battery that I'm essentially entering into the copy to justify or make sense of the claim that I'm actually making next reason why explanation it's a validation to a claim through raising the acceptability of a claim by giving the reader a logical explanation of the claim itself the reason for this is essentially like we talked about before is that you can have high value in low cost in the consumer's mind but if it's too good to be true
11:40
your acceptability is going to be low therefore they won't convert the reason why will give a logical explanation behind why you're making that claim in the first place just like as we said back here making room for summer sale that is a reason why uh type of proof I'm giving a reason why I'm making this claim the reason why it's 50 off is because we're making room for summer all right the more strongly and effectively the emotional appeal is presented the more fully and readily uh will your proof material be accepted and
12:14
believed why is this here again by the legendary Victor Schwab you can actually go read more about types of proof from his book essentially how to write a good advertisement but ins essentially inside of the proof area the proof is only effective when you pull on the right emotional strings and the more shallow and the less effective or less potent I'd say your emotional pull is the the less potent the emotion you're going after is the harder it is for people to grasp the proof that you're giving why because
12:47
like we said in the beginning people want to purchase something their brains will almost look for an excuse to concur with what their heart is telling them what I mean by heart is what their emotions are yearning for right the more someone wants a physical object right let's say I really want a Lamborghini right let's say I want a Lamborghini the less evidence or proof or convincing you're going to have to give me to want that Lamborghini now I don't just want the Lamborghini because I want it I
13:18
could want it because maybe you know if I get it everyone's gonna look at me and my ego is going to be big if I get it I'm gonna be one of the big boys when I drive around town right when I get it people are gonna know who I am I'm pulling at my ego and the ego is so inflated that that is a strong emotion so that when it comes time to convince me of buying a Lamborghini I'm going to look for the easiest possible proof in the reverse effect if I don't necessarily want something if the emotion that I
13:49
have for something is not that strong think again like the sitting on the couch you're hungry but the fridge feels so far away well that emotion for food to satisfy that food is not strong enough and therefore the proof to get me to get up and go get it has to be stronger to overcome it right so what this means essentially as an Advertiser is yes we can have the mechanics of proof yes we can have mechanisms yes we can have all this fancy stuff but at the end of the day it starts with the emotion of your audience
14:24
understand the real emotion that is driving them to search out a product or to be convinced to buy a product do you understand their deepest needs desires wants hates embarrassments loathes hatred rage right you want to know all those ingredients because the more you know them the more you're able to tap into them the less proof you're actually going to need in your advertising and therefore the more effective your proof is whenever you actually do implement it right okay so let's talk about proof
14:56
stacking like I said before they're going to be options and times when you can actually stack the different levels of proof into a headline a sales page a lead you know body copy whatever it is whenever you're stacking uh stacking is when you take various Styles or kinds of proof three plus and layer them together within a headline sub headline or lead so for example this is actually a headline written by the famous copywriter Paris lampropolis I encourage you to go check his stuff out he's a Legend
15:24
um and anyway this is one of the headlines he wrote and as you can see it says scientists discover modern solution to memory problems hidden in 6 000 year old secret scientific studies show it boosts memory speeds up thinking reduces stress and even reverses brain aging now the different there's several different types of proof that he actually implements inside this headline and that's what makes it so effective first he leads it with Scientists what is that that's expert style proof modern solution to memory problems hidden in 6
15:53
000 year old secret that is a form of historical proof then scientific studies show it boosts memory speeds up thinking scientific studies that's a studies type proof thinking reduces stress and even reverses brain aging this whole last sentence reduces stress and even reverses brain aging is a type of reason why proof right reason why proof this actually it just kind of explains like why did scientists discover why were they discovering right if all of a sudden you didn't have this there was no reason for it right people would be
16:28
wondering like what were scientists doing to you know to kind of actually search out for these memory problems like how did this come about right or was it just a claim made up out of thin air no it speeds up thinking reduces stress and even reverses brain aging right it's a soft reason why style of proof so you can see in even one headline and sub headline we have one two three and four styles of proof here being stacked that would be called proof stacking perfect that is the end of these this proof training I'll see you
